## What's Included

### Build System
- Automated builds via GitHub Actions on every commit
- Renovate setup that keeps all your images and actions up to date.
- Automatic cleanup of old images (90+ days) to keep it tidy
- Pull request workflow - test changes before merging to main
  - PRs build and validate before merge
  - `main` branch builds `:stable` images
- Validates your files on pull requests so you never break a build:
  - Brewfile, Justfile, ShellCheck, Renovate config, and it'll even check to make sure the flatpak you add exists on FlatHub
- Production grade features
  - Container signing and SBOM Generation
  - See the checklist below to enable these as they take some manual configuration

### Homebrew Integration
- Pre-configured Brewfiles for easy package installation and customization
- Includes curated collections: development tools, fonts, CLI utilities. Go nuts.
- Users install packages at runtime with `brew bundle`, aliased to premade `ujust commands`
- See [custom/brew/README.md](custom/brew/README.md) for details

### Flatpak Support
- Ship your favorite flatpaks
- Automatically installed on first boot after user setup
- See [custom/flatpaks/README.md](custom/flatpaks/README.md) for details

### ujust Commands
- User-friendly command shortcuts via `ujust`
- Pre-configured examples for app installation and system maintenance for you to customize
- See [custom/ujust/README.md](custom/ujust/README.md) for details

### Build Scripts
- Modular numbered scripts (10-, 20-, 30-) run in order
- Example scripts included for third-party repositories and desktop replacement
- Helper functions for safe COPR usage
- See [build/README.md](build/README.md) for details

## Quick Start

Switch to your image:
```bash
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/florensie/pancake:stable
sudo systemctl reboot
```

- [Build Scripts](build/README.md) - Build-time customization

## Architecture

This template follows the **multi-stage build architecture** from @projectbluefin/distroless, as documented in the [Bluefin Contributing Guide](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/contributing/).

### Multi-Stage Build Pattern

**Stage 1: Context (ctx)** - Combines resources from multiple sources:
- Local build scripts (`/build`)
- Local custom files (`/custom`)
- **@projectbluefin/common** - Desktop configuration shared with Aurora
- **@projectbluefin/branding** - Branding assets
- **@ublue-os/artwork** - Artwork shared with Aurora and Bazzite
- **@ublue-os/brew** - Homebrew integration

**Stage 2: Base Image** - Default options:
- `ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:latest` (Fedora-based, default)
- `quay.io/centos-bootc/centos-bootc:stream10` (CentOS-based alternative)

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Modularity**: Compose your image from reusable OCI containers
- **Maintainability**: Update shared components independently
- **Reproducibility**: Renovate automatically updates OCI tags to SHA digests
- **Consistency**: Share components across Bluefin, Aurora, and custom images

### OCI Container Resources

The template imports files from these OCI containers at build time:

```dockerfile
COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/base-main:latest /system_files /oci/base
COPY --from=ghcr.io/projectbluefin/common:latest /system_files /oci/common
COPY --from=ghcr.io/ublue-os/brew:latest /system_files /oci/brew
```

Your build scripts can access these files at:
- `/ctx/oci/base/` - Base system configuration
- `/ctx/oci/common/` - Shared desktop configuration
- `/ctx/oci/branding/` - Branding assets
- `/ctx/oci/artwork/` - Artwork files
- `/ctx/oci/brew/` - Homebrew integration files

**Note**: Renovate automatically updates `:latest` tags to SHA digests for reproducible builds.

## Local Testing

Test your changes before pushing:

```bash
just build              # Build container image
just build-qcow2        # Build VM disk image
just run-vm-qcow2       # Test in browser-based VM
```

## Security

This template provides security features for production use:
- Optional SBOM generation (Software Bill of Materials) for supply chain transparency
- Optional image signing with cosign for cryptographic verification
- Automated security updates via Renovate
- Build provenance tracking

These security features are disabled by default to allow immediate testing. When you're ready for production, see the "Love Your Image? Let's Go to Production" section above to enable them.
